<h1> kaun banega crorepathi </h1>
this is my first code using javascript and some help from our trusty friend youtube.
It is a simple javascipt program using node.js in command line interface.
The code uses chalk, chalk-animation, figlet, gradient-string, nanospinner to provide a beautiful interface wheras it uses inquirer to create a multiple choice feature when in the cli.

<br />
<h2>you can try it out using this command in the terminal</h2>
<p>By executing the command below in your terminal, you can experience the Kaun Banega Crorepati game:</p>
<b>npx kaun_banega_crorepathi</b>
<br />

<p>This command utilizes <code>npx</code>, which is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher. It allows you to run packages without installing them globally. In this case, it fetches and executes the <code>kaun_banega_crorepathi</code> package.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you're interested in enhancing the game by adding your own questions and answers, you have the option to fork the repository. Forking creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account, allowing you to freely experiment and make changes without affecting the original project. After forking, you can add your own questions and answers to the game and submit them as pull requests to contribute back to the main project.</p>
